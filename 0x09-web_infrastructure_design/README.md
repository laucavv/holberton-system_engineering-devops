### Server
Servers are located in datacenters which are buildings that host hundreds, or even thousands of computers (servers). You can think of a server as a computer without a keyboard, mouse, or screen, that is accessible only by a network. A server can be physical or virtual. A server runs an OS (operating system).

### Web server
**Do not mix up web server and server.**

A web server is a software that delivers web pages. A server is an actual computer.
But you might hear people referring to a web server using the word server.
As mentioned above, a server is a physical machine, an actual computer, but in the Cloud era that could also be a virtual computer, generally called a VM (Virtual Machine) or container.

### DNS
DNS is, in simple words, the technology that translates human-adapted, text-based domain names to machine-adapted, numerical-based IP.

### HTTPS
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure'. It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted.
