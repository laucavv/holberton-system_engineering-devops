# Commands âš™
Commands can be one of 4 different kinds:

- **An executable program** :  like all those files we saw in /usr/bin. Within this category, programs can be compiled binaries such as programs written in C and C++, or programs written in scripting languages such as the shell, Perl, Python, Ruby, etc.

- **A command built into the shell itself** : bash provides a number of commands internally called shell builtins. The cd command, for example, is a shell builtin.

- **A shell function** : These are miniature shell scripts incorporated into the environment. We will cover configuring the environment and writing shell functions in later lessons, but for now, just be aware that they exist.

- **An alias** :  Commands that you can define yourselves, built from other commands. This will be covered in a later lesson.
