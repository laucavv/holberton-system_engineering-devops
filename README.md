# What is the shell?
The shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform
On most Linux systems a program called bash (which stands for Bourne Again SHell, an enhanced version of the original Unix shell program, sh, written by Steve Bourne) acts as the shell program. Besides bash, there are other shell programs that can be installed in a Linux system. These include: **ksh**, **tcsh** and **zsh**.
